# AI-project
In this project, my study partners and I implement a genetic algorithm that, given a short audio file, uses pre-recorded building blocks (e.g. piano notes)
to construct the most similarly-sounding tune.
In addition, we fit a polynomial to the input audio and sample it to generate a different similarly-sounding tune.
